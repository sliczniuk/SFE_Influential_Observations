This study investigates the process of chamomile oil extraction from flowers. A parameter-distributed model consisting of a set of partial differential equations is used to describe the governing mass transfer phenomena in a cylindrical packed bed with solid chamomile particles under supercritical conditions using carbon dioxide as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The empirical correlations used in the model are based on laboratory experiments performed under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40~^\circ$C, $100 - 200$ bar and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. An impact of each data point from the model development sample is assessed. The main goal of this work is to identify which data points have the largest impact on each estimates as well detect potential outliers.
